Majora's Mask Audio Bin Generator

This script automates the creation of an MM Audio Bin file for The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. With this tool, you can easily integrate custom music into the game.

This script requires a decompressed ROM file of the US version of Majora's Mask to function correctly.

Usage
- Simply drag and drop your decompressed US-Majora's Mask ROM onto the script.
- The script will generate the MM-Audio.bin file automatically.
- Move the MM-Audio.bin file to your .../Data/Music folder.

Enjoy the enhanced experience with custom music from Majoras Mask Randomizer in Ocarina of Time Randomizer!'

IMPORTANT:
For the time being i suggest not using the "Display Custom Music Names" Option, due to it showing you under circumstances the full path of the file used instead of the Cusom Music Title.
Also given MMR Music is not "copyright issue" checked as DJ. Use at your own risk.
